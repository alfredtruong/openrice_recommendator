# Recommendation engine for Openrice


This is an attempt in building a recommendation engine for Openrice.


This [Jupyter Notebook](./Openrice_Recommendation_script.ipynb) shows the steps on scraping the openrice website.


Other csv files in this repositary are the data files I used. 


In general, I used SVD from Scipy to perform my recommendation engine. 


I also added additional features where I adjust the recommendation engine to take into account region and restaurant types

# Recommendation engine for Openrice

<br>
This is an attempt in building a recommendation engine for Openrice.

<br>
The [Jupyter Notebook](master/Openrice%20Recommendation%20script.ipynb) shows the steps on scraping the openrice website.

<br>
Other csv files in this repositary are the data files I used. 

<br>
In general, I used SVD from Scipy to perform my recommendation engine. 

I also added additional features where I adjust the recommendation engine to take into account region and restaurant types
